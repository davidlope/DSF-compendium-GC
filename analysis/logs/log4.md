Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:


### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The topic about a healthy lab culture was very personal to me. I just got out of a traumatizing lab experience as a PhD student. I had to pay for my own lab materials...
I believe that professors, students, and other lab members should participate in lab culture workshops to foster a better environment for everyone to work in.
I think that there should be rules for everyone to follow including the PI. I did not know who to talk to about the racial discrimination and verbal abuse I faced from my previous professor.
I found the example provided to us of U MICH to be a good way to start, but departments and the university should create checks and balances on the PIs power over students. 
### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.

I want to learn how to avoid the problems that I faced previously. I am traumatized and doing my best to move forward.
Talking to other students before joining a lab may help but they will not always tell you the truth.
Sometimes you do not know what a lab is truly like unless you experience it.
Rotations are a must, although some departments do not allow this.
There should be department support and a protocol established in case a student and a PI have different points of views and both agree to part ways.



### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I want to know how to discuss my troubles I am having with my PI without the fear of retaliation.
My department did not support me on my case.
There were no clear rules in the grad handbook on how to deal with a PI misbehaving... there is a dean of students office where professors can easily report students...
however there is no dean of professors office where students can report professors for misbehaving.
Professors at Universities are often given absolute power... I want to know how to report a professor for misbehaving without facing retaliation.
I unfortunately faced retaliation and it did not end well...


## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
