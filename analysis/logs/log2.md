## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:


### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
I was exposed to a new method of project management with different roles that I have not heard of before. I want to implement these roles and management approach when I start building a team to help create a database for a new project that I want to lead.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 
I want to learn effective leadership strategies and which software/tools I can use to foster a collaborative environment among my future research team.

I am interested to see if I can create merged excel files using the terminal (might not be possible). I am trying to create a database by merging various excel files. I am currently looking at using PANDAS in PYTHON.
### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I need to see more examples of great and bad project management. I would like an explanation of why something is good and bad. Then I want to create my own and have others critique how I organize and try to make my work reproducible. 
I need more practice with the terminal. It is challenging since I have not used it before. I believe I need more examples to value the use of the terminal.
## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

Look up examples to understand the use of the terminal and why it is valuable.
