## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:


### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I did not know about the FAIR and CARE approach. I did not realize there are many ethics and guidelines to follow. I am just submerged in doing my project and I forget to think about how others can access my work and reproduce it.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.

I want to learn how to use various data management tools such as openproject and dmp tool. It was also interesting to know that CYVERSE offers data storage.


### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I want to see examples of projects that follow the CARE and FAIR approach. I need to see an application of the principles and examples to fully understand how to implement them to my projects. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
