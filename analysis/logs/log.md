## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I found it interesting how we could use the terminal to do various tasks. I have never used the terminal before. 
### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 
I am interested to see if I can create merged excel files using the terminal (might not be possible). I am trying to create a database by merging various excel files. I am currently looking at using PANDAS in PYTHON.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 
I need more practice with the terminal. It is challenging since I have not used it before. I believe I need more examples to value the use of the terminal.

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
Look up examples to understand the use of the terminal and why it is valuable.
