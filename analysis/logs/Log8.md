## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:


### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
 I will take this week to start my step by step guide to manipulating my database to obtain the results relevant to my research. I will start with a base data frame and show the code to manipulate it to obtain the results in my potential manuscript.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.

I need to implement all of the materials in the course to ensure open access and reproducibility of my work.



### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

This will be my first open access repository so it is definitely challenging. Once I have more experience I hope it will not take me as long.


## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
