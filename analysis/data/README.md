# README for data used in the prediction of boiling and melting points of organic compounds using the UPPER approach by Dr. Samuel Yalkowsky and his lab

## Overview 
Data used for manuscript: One boiling and one melting database in .xlsx format created using peer-reviewed papers, NIST, and PUBCHEM.

***

## Purpose of the study 
### To create models that predict physical properties of organic compounds based on structure. 


## Structure of the data
Note: Columns should have information about units, number of levels, or format where appropriate.
#### data1.csv
###### Data set #1
* Column1: Column with no data because it does not exist
* Column2: Another column with no data
* Column3: A third column with no data
